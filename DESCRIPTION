Description: This package includes a data set for minimal inhibitory concentration ('MIC') and inhibition zone diameters ('ZD'). 
  Furthermore, a web scraping function is provided to generate the data sets directly from the homepage EUCAST.
  EcoffinR also contains an algorithm designed to find the Epidemiological Cutoff Value (ECOFF) of pairings of bacteria and antibiotics. 
  Its use is to split bacteria into a resistant and a sensitive group for each antibiotic. 
  A normal distribution is used to estimate the ECOFF from ZD.
